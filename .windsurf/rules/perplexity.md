Use the perplexity MCP server when I say websearch or when up-to-date/extra information is required. Select tools by intent:

perplexity_search → fast, ranked results (default).

perplexity_ask → quick Q&A with live search.

perplexity_research → deep, multi-source analysis only if explicitly requested.

perplexity_reason → advanced reasoning only if explicitly requested.
Run shallow multi-pass queries (broad → focused → examples), cite sources, and proceed only after verifying findings with the returned metadata/citations. Keep scope aligned to the stated intent—no extra steps.
