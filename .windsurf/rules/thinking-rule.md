Use the MCP server @mcp:sequential-thinking: to reason step-by-step.

Rules:
1. Ask @mcp:sequential-thinking: for a short plan (Goal, Steps, Next Action).
2. Execute only the Next Action.
3. After each step, re-run it to update the plan or recover from errors.
4.Re-iterate if required

Output only:
Goal, Plan (numbered), Next Action, Result (or Error+Fix), and brief summary of code changes.

Think sequentially, act precisely.
